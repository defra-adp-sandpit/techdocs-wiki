# Overview

Our roadmap is a strategic planning tool that provides a high-level visual representation of the product vision, goals, and planned initiatives over a specific timeframe.

It serves as a communication and alignment tool for the team and stakeholders, illustrating the planned direction and major milestones of the product's development.

The roadmap is not set in stone but rather a living document that evolves as the product and its requirements evolve.
